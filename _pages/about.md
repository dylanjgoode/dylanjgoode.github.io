### AI Product Management

Being an AI PM means maintaining a disciplined understanding of how the field is evolving, then pressure-testing those developments against real product constraints.

The goal isn’t just to avoid risk, it’s to create strategic advantage by building right at the edge of what the technology can reliably deliver.
