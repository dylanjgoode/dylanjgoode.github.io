After studying economics, I interned at an AI startup working on computer vision for gealic football, then moved to Zurich for a technology consulting role - working on projects for multinationals, scale-ups, and governments with AI and blockchain strategy. I also spent time at ZK Hack where I worked on the website, educational initiatives, and covered zero-knowledge research at conferences.

While reviewing work on ZK-ML, I realized I wanted to be a get a deeper understanding of the state of AI, so I went back to study Information Systems at the University of Amsterdam's CS department. Here I was able to study NLP and information retrieval, carrying out my thesis at the Amsterdam NLP lab on multilingual inference strategies. After graduating, I joined eDesk's product team to bring AI capabilities to their customer support platform. Most recently, I moved to IBM to work on mission-critical infrastructure.
