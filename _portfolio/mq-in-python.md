**[Run IBM MQ with Python MQI on macOS (Apple Silicon)](https://github.com/dylanjgoode/MQ-in-Python)**

This project demonstrates the **Point-to-Point Messaging pattern**, establishing a reliable, one-to-one message flow between a producer and a consumer via a queue.

It serves as a practical guide for developers working with **IBM MQ** on **Apple Silicon (M-series)** chips, covering:
- **Containerization**: Running IBM MQ Developer Edition in Podman/Docker.
- **Configuration**: Setting up queues, channels, and listeners.
- **Development**: Connecting a Python application using the official `ibmmq` library.
