**[Beyond “Think Step-by-Step”: Enhancing Abstract Analogy Reasoning in LLMs with Structured CoT](https://github.com/jakub-podolak/AbstractAnalogies)**

We developed ’Structured CoT’, a novel zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting method, to boost reasoning in medium-sized LLMs. Our study shows marked improvements in abstract analogy tasks with models like LLaMA-3 8B, Starling 7B, and Mistral 7B, enhancing strategies for AI reasoning development.

**Role:** Contributed to experiment design, implementation, data analysis, and co-wrote the paper.
